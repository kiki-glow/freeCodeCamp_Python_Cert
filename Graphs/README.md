The **N-Queens** problem asks you to place N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other (no two share a row, column, or diagonal).

For example, if there is a 4x4 board, one valid arrangement is:

Example Code
[1, 3, 0, 2]
That means that in row 0, the queen is placed in column 1; in row 1, the queen is placed in column 3; in row 2, the queen is placed in column 0; and in row 3, the queen is placed in column 2.

Visually, this arrangement looks like:

Example Code
. Q . .
. . . Q
Q . . .
. . Q .
Where Q represents a queen and . represents an empty square.

In this lab, you will implement the N-Queens problem solver using the depth-first search approach.
